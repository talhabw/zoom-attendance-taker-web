# Zoom Auto Attendance Taker

 A web app to take auto attendance at online classes. You give the list of members to app, and install it's zoom extension to your account. It handles the rest, to give you detailed informations about: who joined to which classs, how many mintues did he/she stay in the meeting, etc.

**Note:** *I developed  this project for my school's robotics club. It is not available to public use at the moment. I will continue to develop it when I have enough time to make it a public app.*
